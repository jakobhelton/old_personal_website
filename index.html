			<h1><u><strong> About Me </strong></u></h1>
			<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Jakob Helton and I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Arizona pursuing a Ph.D. in Astronomy. I am broadly interested in observational extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology, but spend most of my time thinking about the evolution of galaxies' physical conditions across cosmic time. In the coming years, I will be working with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to investigate the earliest phases of galaxy formation ever observed. In addition to my research, I am also a visual artist. I focus on photography and painting, but I have recently started creating digital images and movies. In the coming years, I am hoping to publish a photography book and get my work featured in an art exhibition. You can take a look at my CV 
			<a href="https://jakobhelton.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>,

				<a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank"> The nebular properties of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshift from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census </a>
				<br height='5'>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We present a detailed study of the partial rest-optical (&lambda;<sub>obs</sub> &asymp; 3600-5600 &#8491;) spectra of N = 328 star-forming galaxies at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0, obtained with VLT/VIMOS as part of the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C). We compare this sample with low-redshift (z = 0) galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), intermediate-redshift (z = 1.6) galaxies from the Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS)-COSMOS Survey, and high-redshift (z = 2) galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS). Even at a lookback time of 6-8 Gyr, galaxies at intermediate redshifts with stellar masses 10.25 &lt; log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 11.00 appear remarkably similar to z = 0 galaxies in terms of their nebular excitation, as measured using [OIII]&lambda;5008/H&beta;. There is some evidence that galaxies at the same redshifts with lower stellar masses (10.00 &lt; log(M<sub>&ast;</sub>/M<sub>&odot;</sub>) &lt; 10.25) have elevated [OIII]&lambda;5008/H&beta; when compared to z = 0 galaxies. This may suggest that these galaxies have similarities with less evolved z = 1.6 and z = 2 galaxies, which are offset from the z = 0 locus at all stellar masses. We explore the impact selection effects, contributions from active galactic nuclei, and variations in physical conditions (ionization parameter and gas-phase oxygen abundance) have on the apparent distribution of [OIII]&lambda;5008/H&beta; and find somewhat higher ionization and lower gas-phase enrichment in lower mass galaxies from our 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0 galaxy sample relative to z = 0 galaxies. We use new near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations from Keck/MOSFIRE and Magellan/FIRE for a subsample of N = 53 LEGA-C galaxies to investigate other probes of enrichment (including nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio) and excitation (such as the BPT diagram). Our analysis demonstrates the importance of obtaining complete rest-optical spectra of galaxies in order to disentangle these effects.

				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03858/" target="_blank"> Discovery and origins of giant optical nebulae surrounding quasar PKS 0454-22 </a>
				<br height='5'>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We report optical integral-field spectroscopy in the field of one of the most luminous quasars in the z &lt 1 Universe, PKS 0454-22, with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. These data enable the discovery of three large ionized nebulae emitting in [OII], H&beta;, and [OIII] with projected areas of 1720, 1520, and 130 pkpc<sup>2</sup>, which we refer to as N1, N2, and N3, respectively. N1 spatially and kinematically surrounds the quasar host and five nearby galaxies. The morphology and kinematics of N1 are most consistent with stripped interstellar medium resulting from ongoing interactions. Its ionization properties can be explained by quasar photoionization. N2 spatially and kinematically surrounds two galaxies that are at projected distances of d &asymp; 90 pkpc and line-of-sight velocities of &delta;v &asymp; +1410 km s<sup>-1</sup> from the quasar. The morphology and kinematics of N2 are also consistent with stripped interstellar medium. However, its ionization state requires additional ionization sources beyond the quasar, likely from fast shocks as it moves through the hot halo associated with a galaxy overdensity around the quasar. N3 is not coincident with any galaxies with secure redshifts, and may arise from a cool gas structure in the intragroup medium or a dwarf galaxy. These large ionized nebulae demonstrate that interactions can produce cool gas structures on halo scales, while also possibly facilitating quasar fueling. The growing availability of wide-area integral field spectroscopic data will continue to reveal the morphologies, kinematics, and conditions of the gas flows, which may fuel galaxy and black hole growth.

				<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07288/" target="_blank"> The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR4 maps and cosmological parameters </a>
				<br height='5'>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We present new arcminute-resolution maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropy from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, using data taken from 2013-2016 at 98 and 150 GHz. The maps cover more than 17,000 deg<sup>2</sup>, the deepest 600 deg<sup>2</sup> with noise levels below 10&mu;K-arcmin. We use the power spectrum derived from almost 6,000 deg<sup>2</sup> of these maps to constrain cosmology. The ACT data enable a measurement of the angular scale of features in both the divergence-like polarization and the temperature anisotropy, tracing both the velocity and density at last-scattering. From these one can derive the distance to the last-scattering surface and thus infer the local expansion rate, H<sub>0</sub>. By combining ACT data with large-scale information from WMAP we measure H<sub>0</sub> = 67.6 &plusmn; 1.1 km/s/Mpc, at 68% confidence, in excellent agreement with the independently-measured Planck satellite estimate (from ACT alone we find H<sub>0</sub> = 67.9 &plusmn; 1.5 km/s/Mpc). The &Lambda;CDM model provides a good fit to the ACT data, and we find no evidence for deviations: both the spatial curvature, and the departure from the standard lensing signal in the spectrum, are zero to within 1&sigma; the number of relativistic species, the primordial Helium fraction, and the running of the spectral index are consistent with &Lambda;CDM predictions to within 1.5-2.2&sigma;. We compare ACT, WMAP, and Planck at the parameter level and find good consistency; we investigate how the constraints on the correlated spectral index and baryon density parameters readjust when adding CMB large-scale information that ACT does not measure. The DR4 products presented here will be publicly released on the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis.
